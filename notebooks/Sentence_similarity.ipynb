      "Introduction  The topic of this paper is the manner in which syntactic voice alternations (and syntactic conﬁgurations more generally) relate to voice morphology, and the implications of this for theories of voice and theories of morphology/syntax in- teractions.\n",
      "I argue based on the voice system of Modern Greek for three primary points: ﬁrst, that treatments taking voice morphology as corresponding to a syn- tactic argument of the verb (see references below) will not work for voice systems like Greek; second, that voice morphology in Greek must be analyzed as related to a morphological feature which is added post-syntactically in speciﬁc syntactic conﬁgurations; and, third, that this analysis has consequences for the study of syn- tax/morphology interactions more generally.\n",
      "Please cite this paper as follows:   Newlin-Łukowicz, Luiza (2012).\n",
      "These points and their implications are discussed within the context of the theory of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz (1993) and related work.)\n",
      "In order to establish these points certain sets of theoretical background assumptions must be highlighted; in the following paragraphs I review the major points of this discussion and provide an overview of previous theoretical treatments.  \n",
      "The example (1) illustrates the phenomena of passivisation   which is the topic of our paper.  \n",
      "The ﬁrst set of arguments presented shows that voice morphology in Modern Greek does not correspond to a syntactic argument of the verb.\n",
      "Polish Stress: looking for phonetic evidence of a   bidirectional system.\n",
      "The background for the work presented here is provided by the prevailing syntactic treatment of voice morphology, according to which it is syntactically active in some sense; i.e. by  interacting with Case and\u0001 -role assignment.\n",

      "Abstract:      This  paper  reports  on  a  study  of  Polish  stress,  the  only  uncontested  example  of  a  bidirectional  system  with  internal  lapses  (Kager  2001,  McCarthy  2003).  \n",

      "Most culpable are Sabine Iatridou, Alec Marantz, and Rolf Noyer.\n",
      "The  results  indicate that Polish stress is non-iterative, a finding that seriously calls into question the  existence  of  this  particular  stress  type.  \n",
      "For further helpful discussion I would like to thank Elena Anagnostopoulou, Rajesh Bhatt, Robin Clark, Chung-Hye Han, Angeliek van Hout, Jeff Lidz, Martha McGinnis, David Pesetsky, Don Ringe, Laura Siegel, and the participants in the Round Table.  1  \f",
      "\n",
      "An  analysis  of  the  acoustic  prominence  of  syllables traditionally associated with different stress levels suggests that Polish simple  words exhibit only one (penultimate) prominence.\n",
      "The second part of the discussion is concerned with the proper treat- ment of voice in languages like Greek and the implications of this for the syn- tax/morphology interface.\n",
      "(each implies the other).\n",
      "Beginning with the question of how non-active voice  be treated as making reference to a morphological feature [NonAct] (for ‘Non- Active’), and that this cannot be captured by any type of Lexicalist treatment  the [NonAct] feature in Greek voice alternations is assigned in speciﬁc syntactic conﬁgurations, and reﬂects properties of the syntactic environment rather than itself effecting an alternation.\n",
      "The stress pattern in compounds is less  uniform; they can carry one or two (penultimate) stresses, depending on their prosodic  structure.  \n",
      "Speciﬁcally, I argue that [NonAct] is assigned post-  must be treated if not syntactically, I show in\u0003 5 that the Greek voice system must (Minimalist or otherwise.)\n",
      "I  analyse  the  distribution  of  stresses  in  compounds  as  governed  by  clash  avoidance.  \n",
      "The treatment I propose in\u0003 6 is based on the idea that syntactically to the verb when it (or the\u0004 -V complex) is not in a local relationship addressed in \u0003 6.2.\n",
      "The formal similarity between (1a) and (1b) follows from the  fact that both examples contain close to identical lexical material.\n",
      "Specifically,  compound  stems  are  parsed  into  separate  PWds  and  assigned  separate  stresses  only  if  the  emergent  trochees  are  non-adjacent.  \n",
